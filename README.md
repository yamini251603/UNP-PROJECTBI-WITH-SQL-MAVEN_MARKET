# UNP-PROJECTBI-WITH-SQL-MAVEN_MARKET
I completed this project as part of my MySQL internship with the United Network of Professionals (UNP).

This SQL project involves querying a database, likely from a retail or sales context, to extract valuable insights. 

The queries cover a range of analyses, including total revenue by category and region, average order value, daily sales trends, product profitability, customer count, and territory-wise sales.

These queries provide a comprehensive view of the business's performance, aiding decision-making and strategic planning.
